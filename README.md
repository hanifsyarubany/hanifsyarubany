Exploring Tensorflow that enhance my interest to begin Machine Learning's journey

I was started to explore the google products just now. I was very shocked to knew that there are so many google products. But, there was just one google product that could pull my interest most. It was Tensorflow.

Tensorflow is an open-source platform that have so many libraries, tools, and learning that related to Data Science and Machine Learning. Well, it sounds too exciting for me who always thirst in curiosity to something that technology related. I was started to  scrolled down the webpage in tensorflow.org and found that the the Tensorflow is very similar to Kaggle. It has a large community and enourmous of data that can be tried to practice for those who are enjoy with Data Science or Machine Learning. But, I think tensorflow is better since it is well-being used not only by learners, but also by researcher, scientist, engineer, etc. Tensorflow is very famous for practical machine learning real-world problem  because it has very big libraries in python that allowed the user to build machine learning very easily even for beginners who are just started. It also have so many machine learning project for beginner and expert. 

In brief, i am looking forward for this platform to lead my journey in Machine Learning. I will try to learn how to use it so that my dreams to become an expert at IoT and Machine Learning will become true.
